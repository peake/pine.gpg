---------------------------
Version 1.3.0 - 13 Sep 2014
---------------------------
 * Substantial rewrite of the existing codebase.
 * Data processing is now fully binary safe.
 * Use anonymous pipes instead of temporary files for internal IPC.
 * Replace system(3) calls with fork(2)+exec(3).
 * [NEW] Display filter can now handle multiple PGP messages per email as well
   as better handle text outside of PGP message blocks.
 * Command-line option to print version information (formerly -v) is now -V.
 * [NEW] Command-line option -v (formerly print version) is now for specifying
   verbosity level of GPG output.  Can be used twice for more verbosity.
   See gpg(1), option --verbose for additional information.
 * [SECURITY] Disable core dumps to help prevent leakage of sensitive data.
 * [OBSOLETE] Command-line option -t is still accepted (this may change in
   the future) but now ignored as we no longer use temporary files for IPC.
 * [DEPRECATED] Command-line option -e is now -s.  Option -e is still accepted
   as an alias of -s, but this may change in the future.
 * [NEW] Command-line option -r added for specifying a filter result file.
   See UPGRADING file for a caveat regarding this feature.
 * [NEW] Command-line option -k added for specifying a default signing key.
 * [NEW] Command-line options -S (sign), -E (encrypt), and -B (both) added to
   use sending filter without prompting.
 * [NEW] Command-line option -g added for specifying an alternative path at
   runtime to the GPG binary.
 * [NEW] Abort option added to the sending filter prompt.
 * [NEW] Sending filter prompt now allows for the selection of function without
   the need to press the ENTER key after character input.
 * Documentation updated.

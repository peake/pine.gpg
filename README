PINE.GPG - Bringing together PINE and GPG
-----------------------------------------

PINE.GPG is a message filter for (Al)pine, giving it the ability to interface
with GnuPG.  It lets the user verify signed incoming messages, decrypt
encrypted incoming messages, and encrypt and/or sign outgoing messages.

It was coded under Linux so it should compile and run on any modern distro
with gcc and glibc installed.  Other platforms are currently untested, but
any feedback and/or patches are welcome.

There are quite a few "PGP" type filters available for (Al)pine.  Here's some
information for helping to decide if PINE.GPG is right for you:

Some advantages over other PGP filters:

  Accounts for text outside of PGP message blocks.
  Able to handle multiple PGP messages per email.
  Fast, optimized C code.
  Easy to set up and use with no external dependencies or config files to edit.

Some disadvantages over other PGP filters:

  Only supports GnuPG, no support for any other PGP software.

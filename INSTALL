First, the program needs to be configured, built, and installed using the
following commands:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

Next, three filters need to be set up in your (Al)pine configuration.  To get
to (Al)pine's configuration editor, use the following key sequence from within
(Al)pine: m s c

  Add these display filters (line broken for readability):

    _BEGINNING("-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----")_ \
      /usr/local/bin/pine.gpg -d -i _TMPFILE_

    _BEGINNING("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----")_ \
      /usr/local/bin/pine.gpg -d -i _TMPFILE_

  Add this sending filter:

    /usr/local/bin/pine.gpg -s -i _TMPFILE_ -r _RESULTFILE_ _RECIPIENTS_

To exit the config editor and save the changes, use the key sequence: e y

Finally, enjoy!

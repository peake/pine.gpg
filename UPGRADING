---------------------------------------------
Upgrading from version 1.1.x to version 1.3.0
---------------------------------------------

The sending filter prompt now no longer requires the user to press the ENTER
key after character input.  This matches (Al)pine's behavior and should be
easy to adapt to.

The -e option is deprecated and has been replaced by the -s option.  It is
still accepted as an alias of -s, but should be changed to -s in one's
configured filters as it may be removed in a future release.

The -t option is now obsolete.  It is still accepted, but should be removed
from one's configured filters as it may be removed in a future release.

The -r option is available to have PINE.GPG print its completion status or any
errors to a temporary file that is read back by (Al)pine and either displayed
in the status area if there is enough room, or in its own viewer window
otherwise.  If this option is not specified, any error encountered will cause
the program to halt and require the user to acknowledge the error by pressing
the ENTER key.  See the INSTALL file for how to make use of this feature.

****************   NOTICE REGARDING RESULT FILE (-r) OPTION   *****************
In testing this feature, routine delays were experienced when using it with
the display filter.  If you use this option and get a second or more pause
coupled with a blank screen between selecting an email message and its contents
being displayed, remove this option from your configured display filters.
